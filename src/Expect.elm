module Expect exposing (Expectation, pass, fail, getFailure, equal, notEqual, atMost, lessThan, greaterThan, atLeast, true, false, equalLists, equalDicts, equalSets, onFail)

{-| A library to create `Expectation`s, which describe a claim to be tested.

## Quick Reference

* [`equal`](#equal) `(arg2 == arg1)`
* [`notEqual`](#notEqual) `(arg2 /= arg1)`
* [`lessThan`](#lessThan) `(arg2 < arg1)`
* [`atMost`](#atMost) `(arg2 <= arg1)`
* [`greaterThan`](#greaterThan) `(arg2 > arg1)`
* [`atLeast`](#atLeast) `(arg2 >= arg1)`
* [`true`](#true) `(arg == True)`
* [`false`](#false) `(arg == False)`

## Basic Expectations

@docs Expectation, equal, notEqual

## Comparisons

@docs lessThan, atMost, greaterThan, atLeast

## Booleans

@docs true, false

## Collections

@docs equalLists, equalDicts, equalSets

## Customizing

@docs pass, fail, onFail, getFailure
